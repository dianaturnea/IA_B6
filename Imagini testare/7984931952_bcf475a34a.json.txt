She was helped in this by the fact that in destroying then c. 135, the Romans had built pagan shrines over many of these sites! \n\nHaving located, close together, what she believed to be the sites of the Crucifixion and of the Burial (at locations that modern archaeologists think may be correct), she then had built over them the great church of the Holy Sepulchre, which was dedicated on 14 September 335. In this church was displayed a precious relic - part of the wood of the Cross on which Jesus was crucified, the &quot;true Cross&quot;. \n\nHenceforth, this day has become a day for recognizing the Cross as a symbol of triumph, and as a sign of Christ's victory over death.\n\nThis statue of St Helena is in St Dominic's priory church in London, and my sermon for today's feast of the Holy Cross can be read <a href=\"http:\/\/lawrenceop.tumblr.com\/post\/31513686061\/homily-for-the-exaltation-of-the-holy-cross-num\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>."}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1347612099", "taken":"2008-07-11 15:07:22", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1351099192"}, "views":"80", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"1"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"419657-7984931952-22530", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Helena", "_content":"helena", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-95469", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Holy Cross", "_content":"holycross", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-1007547", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"True Cross", "_content":"truecross", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-938", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"saint", "_content":"saint", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-10901", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"queen", "_content":"queen", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-21908", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"empress", "_content":"empress", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-4035", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"cross", "_content":"cross", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-79301", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"St Dominic's", "_content":"stdominics", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-63640", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"priory", "_content":"priory", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-765", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"church", "_content":"church", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-595", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"London", "_content":"london", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-7984931952-3652", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Dominican", "_content":"dominican", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/paullew\/7984931952\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
