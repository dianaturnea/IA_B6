I am not exaggerating. There was no mattress (the bed on the right) because the mattress was used to add an extra person to the room so Stephanie and I slept on wood. It was sooo uncomfortable.\n\nBut the area was gorgeous. The chinese countryside is beautiful. I want to go back and just spend the day taking photos. \n\nI'm really taking the &quot;Take pictures for you from the heart&quot; philosophy to heart. I've been thinking of changing my 365 rules, for a few reasons. I'll talk about that later.
