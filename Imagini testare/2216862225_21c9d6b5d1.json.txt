DO NOT FEEL YOU HAVE TO COMMENT.Thanks.\n\nAttuf Ridge, Petra, Jordan\n\nAs you reach the top of the mountain you will come to what is known as Attuf Ridge. On this ridge are two obelisks, such as are found in India. They are carved out of solid rock and are over 6 meters high.  They have been noted as Nabataean as one of them still has the typical Nabataean style of haching (etching) on the side that is protected from the prevailing winds. They are believed to represent the two most important Nabataean gods, Dushara and Al Uzza. The picture was taken from higher up looking down at the two obelisks. Notice how the mountain has been cleared away and a flat surface surrounds the obelisks. The stones or obelisks are not set in place but rather the mountain was carved away from them.\n\nDushara, was a sun-god, much like other gods throughout the ancient world. He could not be represented by an idol, only as an abstract symbol. Dushara was represented by a tall, four-cornered monolith, usually in rough-cut black stone. These were placed near graves, along roadways, in temples and shrines, or virtually anywhere as a reminder, much as the Christian cross is place din various locations.\n\nAl-'Uzza was the goddess of power. The chief goddesses of the Nabataean pantheon were Al-'Uzza, Allat, and Manawat. Under Hellenization, Al-'Uzza was later identified with Aphrodite, Urania\/Venus Caelestis, and also linked to the Egyptian goddess, Isis.\n"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1280162640", "taken":"2004-10-13 07:37:00", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1329928997"}, "views":"661", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"37"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"22470369-2216862225-11494", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"Jordan", "_content":"jordan", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-6801", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"Petra", "_content":"petra", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-33635", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"monuments", "_content":"monuments", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-56111", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"tombs", "_content":"tombs", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-5960044", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"Nabataeans", "_content":"nabataeans", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-78390", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"Romans", "_content":"romans", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-3082", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"sandstone", "_content":"sandstone", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-852", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"colors", "_content":"colors", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-3672", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"colours", "_content":"colours", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-327794", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"Khazneh", "_content":"khazneh", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-28557436", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"Archer10", "_content":"archer10", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-27898", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"Dennis", "_content":"dennis", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"22470369-2216862225-44786019", "author":"22490717@N02", "raw":"Dennis G.
