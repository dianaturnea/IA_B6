It was a mixed group of youth, boys and girls, and I shot a variety of pix, but had a lot of lighting issues, hate to admit, so what did turn out, I played up with filters, having fun with the wild colors that they all had on their faces, body, and in their crazy hair.  They were good kids, some in their school girl skirts, just out having some Halloween fun.  My son, Patrick, was across the street, actually, at the Manor Branch Public Library, enjoying the festivities put on by the library.  That really warmed my heart to know he was there, having fun, doing something kid-like, his age, and enjoying it, especially, at the library.  I wanted to take pictures, but I knew better to just leave him alone.  With what we are going through with him, this is a moment to treasure, for him, alone.  I will just savor the moment, knowing he was there, and safe and sound, for that time anyway.
