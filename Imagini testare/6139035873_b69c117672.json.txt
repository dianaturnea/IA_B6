Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the southern hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees. The quintessential toadstool, it is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually deep red mushroom, one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture. Several subspecies, with differing cap colour, have been recognised to date, including the brown regalis (considered a separate species), the yellow-orange flavivolvata, guessowii, and formosa, and the pinkish persicina. Genetic studies published in 2006 and 2008 show several sharply delineated clades which may represent separate species.\n\nAlthough it is generally considered poisonous, deaths from its consumption are extremely rare, and it is eaten as a food in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America after parboiling. Amanita muscaria is now primarily famed for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. It was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia and has a religious significance in these cultures.\n\nAmanita muscaria poisoning typically occurs in either young children or people ingesting it for a hallucinogenic experience.[12][46][47] Occasionally, immature button forms have been mistaken for edible puffballs.[48] Additionally, the white spots may be washed away during heavy rain and it can then appear similar to the edible A. caesarea.[49]\n\nToxicity\n\nAmanita muscaria contains a number of biologically active agents, at least two of which, muscimol and ibotenic acid, are known to be psychoactive. A toxic dose in adults is approximately 6 mg muscimol or 30 to 60 mg ibotenic acid;[50][51] this is typically about the amount found in one cap of Amanita muscaria.[52] However, the amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which further confuses the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times as much ibotenic acid and muscimol compared to autumn fruitings.[46]\n\nA fatal dose has been calculated at approximately 15 caps.[53] Deaths from A. muscaria have been reported in historical journal articles and newspaper reports;[54][55][56] however, with modern medical treatment a fatal outcome would be extremely rare.[57] Many older books mistakenly list it as deadly, giving the impression that it is far more toxic than it really is.[58] The North American Mycological Association has stated there are no reliably documented fatalities in the past 100 years.[59] The vast majority (90% or more) of mushroom poisoning deaths are from having eaten either the greenish to yellowish death cap (A. phalloides) or one of the several white Amanita species known as destroying angels.[60]\n\nThe active constituents of this species are water soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water will at least partly detoxify A. muscaria.[61] However, drying may increase potency as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol.[62] According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.[63]\n\nSymptoms\n\nFly agarics are known for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount ingested per body weight, effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.[46][47][52][55]\n\nIn cases of serious poisoning it causes a delirium, similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning it is characterized by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of central nervous system depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings.[47][52] Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for a number of days.[49][51] In the majority of cases recovery is complete within 12 to 24 hours.[61] The effect is highly variable between individuals with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions.[46][51][75] Some cases of intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards.[51] Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.[52]\n\nPsychoactive use\n\nUnlike psilocybin mushrooms, Amanita muscaria is a deliriant\/dissociative (as opposed to a psychedelic; see hallucinogens) and has been rarely consumed recreationally because of its toxicity and sometimes intensely unpleasant effects. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin-containing mushrooms in the United Kingdom, an increased quantity of legal A. muscaria mushrooms began to be sold and consumed.[82] Professor Marija Gimbutas, a renowned Lithuanian historian, reported to R. Gordon Wasson on the use of this mushroom in Lithuania. In remote areas of Lithuania Amanita muscaria has been taken at wedding feasts, in which mushrooms were mixed with vodka. The professor also reported that the Lithuanians used to export quantities of A. muscaria to the Lapps in the Far North for use in shamanic rituals. The Lithuanian festivities are the only report that Wasson received of ingestion of fly agaric for recreational use in Eastern Europe.[83]\n\nVikings\n\nA single source for the notion that Vikings used A. muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first suggested by the Swedish professor Samuel \u00d6dman in 1784.[102] \u00d6dman based his theories on reports about the use of fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Today, it is generally considered an urban legend or at best speculation that cannot be proven. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but could create a range of reactions within a range of people.[103] It is possible that it could make a person incredibly angry, as well as make them &quot;very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright&quot;.[103]\n\nCulinary use\n\nThe toxins in A. muscaria are water soluble. When sliced thinly, or chopped into thin dice and boiled in plentiful water until thoroughly cooked, it seems to be detoxified.[63] Although its consumption as a food has never been widespread, the consumption of detoxified A. muscaria has been practiced in some localities in Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th Century, the French physician F\u00e9lix Archim\u00e8de Pouchet was a popularizer and advocate of A. muscaria consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that nevertheless must be detoxified before consumption.[63]\n\nUse of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in North America as well. A classic description of this use of A. muscaria by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late nineteenth century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar is made into a mushroom sauce for steak.[110] It is also consumed as a food in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.[111]\n\nA 2008 paper by food historian William Rubel and mycologist David Arora gives a history of consumption of A. muscaria as a food and describes detoxification methods. They advocate that Amanita muscaria be described in field guides as an edible mushroom, though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it. The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a reflection of cultural bias, as several other popular edible species, notably morels, are toxic unless properly cooked.[63]\n\n\n\nShroomery.org : This eastern North American species is often mis-named as Amanita muscaria var. formosa, and not without good reason. It is essentially a formosa-like variant of the North American clade of the muscaria group.\n\nDNA studies have not yet shown that all guessowii are descended from a single ancestor, and its possible that the yellow cap is simply a common polymorhism in eastern fly agarics.  Therefor it's possible that the term var. guessowii will become obsolete, and the mushroom will simply be known as the yellow form of Amanita amerimuscaria. If it can be demonstrated that this variety is monophyletic (descends from a single ancestor), then it would likely be renamed to Amanita amerimuscaria var. guessowii."}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1315808149", "taken":"2011-09-11 11:49:56", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1327691261"}, "views":"168", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"1"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"46633854-6139035873-139222", "author":"46639194@N05", "raw":"champignons", "_content":"champignons", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"46633854-6139035873-67830", "author":"46639194@N05", "raw":"for\u00eat", "_content":"for\u00eat", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"46633854-6139035873-1233105", "author":"46639194@N05", "raw":"amanites", "_content":"amanites", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"46633854-6139035873-86955", "author":"46639194@N05", "raw":".Amanita", "_content":"amanita", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"46633854-6139035873-376582", "author":"46639194@N05", "raw":"muscaria", "_content":"muscaria", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"46633854-6139035873-52343", "author":"46639194@N05", "raw":"var.", "_content":"var", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"46633854-6139035873-29380", "author":"46639194@N05", "raw":"formosa", "_content":"formosa", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"46633854-6139035873-4261044", "author":"46639194@N05", "raw":"guessowii", "_content":"guessowii", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/demartigny\/6139035873\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
