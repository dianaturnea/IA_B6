Sunrise is the best time to Photograph with warm light on Tetons. I have seen countless of them on the web.\n\nAfter hectic trip of Yellowstone I drove to Colter Bay Village in heavy rain for a night stay. Before going to bed looked outside it was still drizzling, still set alarm to 4:30am keeping hopes alive :)\n\nI have kind of memorized that I need to take right at Moron junction, kind of ignorant to turn-on GPS. Well ended up driving towards Dubios and it took some time to realize that I have headed in wrong route.\n\nDrove back to Antelopes rd, by that time already it was too late to get that initial warm light. This is all I could capture!\n\nThis barn is located on Antelope Flats Rd and Mormon Row intersection.  Here are the Google coordinates of the location: +43\u00b0 39' 57.94&quot;, -110\u00b0 39' 43.59&quot;\n\n\u00a92008 Raj Hanchanahal.\nIf you want to use any of my image, please contact me for authorization.\n"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1251533049", "taken":"2009-08-29 01:07:28", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1294395041"}, "views":"344", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"19"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[]}, "location":{"latitude":43.666606, "longitude":-110.660294, "accuracy":"16", "context":"0", "locality":{"_content":"Grovont", "place_id":"mBiw.GFTVrswMzBn", "woeid":"2415376"}, "county":{"_content":"Teton", "place_id":"QXHq7X1QUL940rm5Ig", "woeid":"12590625"}, "region":{"_content":"Wyoming", "place_id":"ZzxV2f5TUb5yo8Rk", "woeid":"2347609"}, "country":{"_content":"United States", "place_id":"nz.gsghTUb4c2WAecA", "woeid":"23424977"}, "place_id":"mBiw.GFTVrswMzBn", "woeid":"2415376"}, "geoperms":{"ispublic":1, "iscontact":0, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/nhanchanahal\/3866384863\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
