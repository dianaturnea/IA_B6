And at his gate there lay a poor man called Lazarus, covered with sores, who longed to fill himself with the scraps that fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Dogs even came and licked his sores. Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.\n\nIn his torment in Hades he looked up and saw Abraham a long way off with Lazarus in his bosom. So he cried out, \u201cFather Abraham, pity me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in these flames.\u201d \u201cMy son,\u201d Abraham replied \u201cremember that during your life good things came your way, just as bad things came the way of Lazarus. Now he is being comforted here while you are in agony. But that is not all: between us and you a great gulf has been fixed, to stop anyone, if he wanted to, crossing from our side to yours, and to stop any crossing from your side to ours.\u201d\n\nThe rich man replied, \u201cFather, I beg you then to send Lazarus to my father\u2019s house, since I have five brothers, to give them warning so that they do not come to this place of torment too.\u201d \u201cThey have Moses and the prophets,\u201d said Abraham \u201clet them listen to them..\u201d \u201cAh no, father Abraham,\u201d said the rich man \u201cbut if someone comes to them from the dead, they will repent.\u201d Then Abraham said to him, \u201cIf they will not listen either to Moses or to the prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone should rise from the dead.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2013 Luke 16:19-31, which is today's Gospel.\n\nThis tiled panel of Moses, Abraham, Miriam, and other great figures of the Old Testament is in All Saints' church, Margaret Street in London."}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1331208055", "taken":"2008-07-10 15:09:01", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1333545516"}, "views":"218", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"0"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"419657-6964061385-595", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"London", "_content":"london", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-78918", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"All Saints", "_content":"allsaints", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-72080", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Margaret Street", "_content":"margaretstreet", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-96025", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Butterfield", "_content":"butterfield", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-1219001", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Anglo-Catholic", "_content":"anglocatholic", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-12518", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Moses", "_content":"moses", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-45576", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Miriam", "_content":"miriam", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-6549", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Aaron", "_content":"aaron", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-9485", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Abraham", "_content":"abraham", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-63", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Noah", "_content":"noah", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-31715", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"Abel", "_content":"abel", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-836863", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"patriarchs", "_content":"patriarchs", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"419657-6964061385-177877", "author":"35409814@N00", "raw":"prophets", "_content":"prophets", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/paullew\/6964061385\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
