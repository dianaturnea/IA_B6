Even so, he said they were really happy with the results. &quot;Supposedly, they got some really good stuff on both buildings,&quot; he said. The crew filmed both in the hotel, which was the fourth hospital in Jerome during it's mining heyday, and in the Clubhouse, which sits next door and was the third hospital in town.\n\nThe Jerome Grand Hotel is well known as a haunted structure. Over the years, the Altherr brothers, Robert and Larry, have had a book at the front desk of the hotel for guests to enter descriptions of their own personal experience with the hotel's ghosts.\n\n&quot;There is an entry at least every other day,&quot; said Robert. &quot;It will be that somebody heard something or saw something.&quot;\n\nSome of the common experiences include orbs caught by cameras, or mist, or shadows - including, sometimes, a face. Other guests have reported seeing two red dots close together that appear to be floating up or down a stairwell or hallway.\n\nThe occurrences are so common that the Altherrs offer ghost tours, usually Monday through Thursday for the hotel's guests.\n\nDuring those tours, special equipment, such as ghost meters, infra red thermometers, digital cameras and digital recorders, are used to detect signs of paranormal activity.\n\nRobert said there are many &quot;believers&quot; because the evidence seems to be overwhelming. &quot;But it isn't negative,&quot; he said. &quot;It's mostly fun and positive.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jeromegrandhotel.net\/Hotel_History.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.jeromegrandhotel.net\/Hotel_History.htm<\/a>\n&quot;What makes the Jerome Grand Hotel a worthwhile place to stay, is the fact that this is probably one of the most active haunted locations in the world,&quot; according to ghostlyfavorites.com. &quot;Due to the high level of activity in the hotel, it is a quite popular destination for amateur ghost hunters.&quot;\n\nThere are stories of strange noises coming from empty rooms; coughing, labored breathing, and even voices. Sometimes these noises come from a dark corner of a guest's room! Others report lights or TV's turning on and off. There are unexplained smells of flowers, dust, cigarettes and whiskey. Ghostly presences and unexplained activities lure many to this haunted hotel.\n\nTwo female apparitions have been seen by numerous visitors. The first, a nurse carrying a clipboard, seems more to be a memory than an actual ghost. She roams the halls, pausing at intervals and leaning down, looking at beds that no longer exist and patients long since dead. The other, a woman in white, has been identified as a woman who died in childbirth. Neither she nor her baby left the hospital halls. According to legend she is distraught over the treatment of her dead child, who was buried in an unmarked grave. According to the locals, she stalks the hotel, searching for her child's final resting place. \n\nExperience the thrill of the ghost hunter night at the Jerome Grand Hotel. See the elevator shaft where the famous ghost, Claude Harvey, was found. Although his death was ruled accidental, hear the suspicious circumstances surrounding it! Go floor to floor in search of orbs and apparitions using state of the art equipment. Capture the ghosts on camera if you can.\n\nAs the largest National Historic Landmark building in Jerome, AZ and at one mile high, the views from the Jerome Grand Hotel are breathtaking. Located near downtown, Jerome offers a unique experience stay with shopping, art galleries, entertainment, hiking trails, the Jerome State Park and much much more.
