Without warning on March 18th, Barack Obama announced that NATO was taking over the operation from the United Nations, and it is now admitted freely by the USA, NATO and our own William Hague that the mission is actually to kill Colonel Gaddafi - in flagrant violation of International Law, regardless of where one's sympathies lie. It is yet another illegal war launched by the USA, Britain and France against yet another (strangely coincidentally) oil-rich sovereign state which was posing no threat to the USA whatsoever - unless, of course, you include Gadaffi's announced plans to stop trading oil in US dollars and Euros and to move onto a gold standard.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.alhayatwadounia.com\/?p=1386\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.alhayatwadounia.com\/?p=1386<\/a> \n\nIt is a good indicator of the degree to which we have been lied to as a nation by David Cameron, his ministers and &quot;special advisors&quot; in the concentrated media propaganda storm of distortions, myths and blatant lies neccessary to convince the British Public that this illegal war has some kind of moral justification. We were initially told this &quot;humanitarian&quot; mission would be over in weeks and would be a bargain at &quot;tens of millions of pounds&quot;. Over four months later the government has admitted that the cost so far has been &quot;About a quarter of a billion pounds&quot;, from which we can safely assume we're probably looking at closer to half a billion pounds at the very least, with no end in sight.\n\nIt was announced by the Ministry of Defence today that another four RAF Tornado fighter bombers would be joining aerial missions over Libya, which is additional to the four extra Tornados deployed in April. It is now discovered - but not admitted in public by the government, even in Parliament - that the UK has commenced aerial Drone operations over Libya. I fear the true scale, costs and consequences of UK involvement in this dispute may take many years to uncover by which time, of course, all the main players will all be safely retired from government and will be reaping their rewards in the form of lucrative directorships of banks, oil and armaments companies which is the time-honoured British way.\n\nAs Tariq Ali so eloquently pointed out later that evening in the Parliamentary Afghanistan Withdrawl Group public meeting in the Houses of Parliament, support for the end of NATO bombing in Libya does not in any way imply sympathy for the Gadaffi regime any more than wanting to end the war against Iraq implied support for Saddam Hussein.\n\n<i>All Photos \u00a9 2011 Pete Riches<\/i>"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1310740850", "taken":"2011-07-12 18:21:21", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1313252631"}, "views":"46", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"0"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[]}, "location":{"latitude":51.498992, "longitude":-0.126374, "accuracy":"16", "context":"0", "neighbourhood":{"_content":"Whitehall", "place_id":"9bQqh4JVVr5RVw", "woeid":"44417"}, "locality":{"_content":"London", "place_id":"hP_s5s9VVr5Qcg", "woeid":"44418"}, "county":{"_content":"Greater London", "place_id":"RcWoHEVTUb4U88DIPw", "woeid":"23416974"}, "region":{"_content":"England", "place_id":"2eIY2QFTVr_DwWZNLg", "woeid":"24554868"}, "country":{"_content":"United Kingdom", "place_id":"cnffEpdTUb5v258BBA", "woeid":"23424975"}, "place_id":"9bQqh4JVVr5RVw", "woeid":"44417"}, "geoperms":{"ispublic":1, "iscontact":0, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/stopthewar\/5939720431\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
