It was shivering so much, so I gave it a bowl of warm water and my neighbor gave it some tuna.\n\nThen I swaddled it in a towel and cradled it while waiting for the local animal shelter to pick it up. I didn't want to bring him in the house and cause a ruckus with the cats, so we hung out in the garage to get out of the wind. When the officer arrived, she scanned it and discovered that the dog was chipped. So they should be able to find its owner. Sometimes people don't update their contact info in the chip registrations, so in the event that they can't find the owner, this guy will be kept at the shelter for 7 days waiting for the owners to claim him. After that he'll be put up for adoption--a little guy with a face like this would likely get adopted in a day!\n\nI've always said that I'd want a medium-sized dog that could play frisbee with me, but I have to say that after cuddling with this guy I can see the allure of the purse dog. And I know it was probably because he was cold and scared, but this guy was so quiet and gentle. &hearts;"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1322063859", "taken":"2011-11-23 09:03:38", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1322166534"}, "views":"109", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"3"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"63693-6389649133-22106", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"springfield", "_content":"springfield", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-2556", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"illinois", "_content":"illinois", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-1017706", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"sangamon", "_content":"sangamon", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-18228", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"stray", "_content":"stray", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-355", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"dog", "_content":"dog", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-1803", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"lost", "_content":"lost", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-742", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"yorkie", "_content":"yorkie", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-6046", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"yorkshire", "_content":"yorkshire", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-12353", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"terrier", "_content":"terrier", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-952", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"animal", "_content":"animal", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-30148", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"shelter", "_content":"shelter", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"63693-6389649133-18128", "author":"48169980@N00", "raw":"chip", "_content":"chip", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/kidmissile\/6389649133\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
