Mount Oberon rises up from the bay - its peak part hidden by this lower ridge.  The sand is white and  courser than the other close by beaches.  It feels terrific on the souls of your feet -  a cooling massage.  The water was a little chilly to start with, we were there in November, but soon enough we were playing happily in the crystal waters.\n\nPeople are often completely unaware of God - but God is intimately aware of them. There are signposts pointing the way to God for every one to see - but no one is forced to look."}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1261170778", "taken":"2009-11-18 14:18:42", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1345702457"}, "views":"98", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"17"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"34202408-4196047150-79281", "author":"34225462@N03", "raw":"Wilson's Prom", "_content":"wilsonsprom", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34202408-4196047150-10339853", "author":"34225462@N03", "raw":"Little Oberon Bay", "_content":"littleoberonbay", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34202408-4196047150-704", "author":"34225462@N03", "raw":"beach", "_content":"beach", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34202408-4196047150-1318", "author":"34225462@N03", "raw":"swim", "_content":"swim", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34202408-4196047150-7373981", "author":"34225462@N03", "raw":"ImpressedBeauty", "_content":"impressedbeauty", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/lensonlife\/4196047150\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
