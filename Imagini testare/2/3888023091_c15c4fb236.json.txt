And no, it isn't another woman. With the Gita (the holy book of the Hindus) tucked under his arm, a walking stick and an umbrella he makes an amusing show of going away to Kasi (a holy place in North India) to become an ascetic, far away from the impending life as a householder. Vyshnavi's father intercepts and convinces him (read: puts some sens into his head) to stay back and marry his daughter. A very pliant Karthik agrees and returns to the mandapam (mun-duh-pum)."}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1252117043", "taken":"2009-09-04 20:17:23", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1252117552"}, "views":"61", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"0"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"955606-3888023091-40582", "author":"70524080@N00", "raw":"indiatrip", "_content":"indiatrip", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"955606-3888023091-45235669", "author":"70524080@N00", "raw":"Kasi Yathirai", "_content":"kasiyathirai", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/kittygutz\/3888023091\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
