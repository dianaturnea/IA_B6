We managed to get out all the way to the second island right behind Vishnu's arm in this photo. I think it was about a mile out. We spotted two turtles on our adventure, when we arrived to the small sandy area we found that there were waves coming from either side of us and crashing perpendicular to the island, something I've never seen before. There was an abundant reef with many snorkelers and people on boats\/kayaks\/paddle boards some of which were surfing the waves. We decided to try surfing a wave with us both on the paddle board, but turning in the right direction was hard b\/c we had limited time to get facing the right way before a wave would come. we ended up riding a calmer wave onto the island. We walked around a little before attempting to get back into the water, it was hard because the waves coming from both sides of the beach &amp; would crash together in the middle, so again we had limited time to get out before waves came crashing into us, unfortunately we weren't quick enough so a wave came and knocked us over. HA. but we eventually made it and we were on our way back when we found a coconut floating in the middle of the ocean which we grabbed and brought back to shore. It was a lot of fun and a great day to start off the new year!\n\nBy Ganesha Balunsat\nfollow me on twitter: twitter.com\/GaneshaIsis"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1262481574", "taken":"2010-01-01 17:23:24", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1319740866"}, "views":"398", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"4"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":1}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"34394586-4238450545-123612", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"kailua", "_content":"kailua", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-1957914", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"mokula", "_content":"mokula", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-1870", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"island", "_content":"island", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-2405", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"ganesha", "_content":"ganesha", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-44237", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"isis", "_content":"isis", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-24459636", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"balunsat", "_content":"balunsat", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-39029559", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"cheekaroo", "_content":"cheekaroo", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-2048", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"hawaii", "_content":"hawaii", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-4596", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"oahu", "_content":"oahu", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-704", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"beach", "_content":"beach", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-1973", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"rebel", "_content":"rebel", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-3053803", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"xti", "_content":"xti", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-201", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"winter", "_content":"winter", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-48795", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"2009", "_content":"2009", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-113574", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"2010", "_content":"2010", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-95", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"new", "_content":"new", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-22411", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"years", "_content":"years", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-1642504", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"project365", "_content":"project365", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"34394586-4238450545-24181", "author":"34415916@N07", "raw":"365", "_content":"365", "machine_tag":0}]}, "location":{"latitude":21.38849, "longitude":-157.712388, "accuracy":"13", "context":"0", "neighbourhood":{"_content":"Lanikai", "place_id":"W2Pu1_5TVrmh0Iey", "woeid":"2436415"}, "locality":{"_content":"Kailua", "place_id":"4PCxkU9TVrkkzDgL", "woeid":"2430455"}, "county":{"_content":"Honolulu", "place_id":"rN.ivOpQUL.9e4Dlxw", "woeid":"12588030"}, "region":{"_content":"Hawaii", "place_id":".w5lRUZTUb5xnIgm", "woeid":"2347570"}, "country":{"_content":"United States", "place_id":"nz.gsghTUb4c2WAecA", "woeid":"23424977"}, "place_id":"W2Pu1_5TVrmh0Iey", "woeid":"2436415"}, "geoperms":{"ispublic":1, "iscontact":0, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/ganesha_isis\/4238450545\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
