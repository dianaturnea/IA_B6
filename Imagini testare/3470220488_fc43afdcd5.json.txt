I was hooked on the stage song and dance ever since (that was Grade 4). I remember saving up so much of my allowance so that I could attend, even if solo, as the youngest kid in the audience (yes there were a few balcony seats, but many splurges up front).\n\nYes, there was a good representation of Andrew Lloyd Webber material. I caught every known musical of his when I could where ever I might have been. For me, it brought me back to late elementary - Junior High when musicals, and not food, was my true passion. Ah the memories.
