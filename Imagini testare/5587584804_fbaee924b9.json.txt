Large parts are comprised by the Berchtesgaden National Park.\n\nLying within the Berchtesgaden Alps in the municipality of Sch\u00f6nau am K\u00f6nigsee, just south of Berchtesgaden and the Austrian City of Salzburg, the K\u00f6nigssee is Germany's third deepest lake. Located at a Jurassic rift it was formed by glaciers during the last ice age. It stretches about 7.7 km (5 mi) in the north-south direction and is about 1.7 km (1 mi) across at its widest point. Except at its outlet, the K\u00f6nigsseer Ache at the village of K\u00f6nigssee, the lake similar to a fjord is surrounded by steeply rising flanks of mountains up to 2700 m (8900 ft), including the fabled Watzmann massif in the west.\n\nThe literal translation appears to be &quot;King's Lake&quot;, however while German: K\u00f6nig does indeed mean &quot;king&quot;, there had been no Bavarian kings since the days of Louis the German until Elector Maximilian I Joseph assumed the royal title in 1806. Therefore the name more probably stems from the first name Kuno of local nobles, who appear in several historical sources referring to the donation of the Berchtesgaden Provostry in the 12th century; the lake was formerly called Kunigsee.\n\nThe lake is noted for its clear water and is advertised as the cleanest lake in Germany. For this reason, only electric driven passenger ships, rowing and pedal boats have been permitted on the lake since 1909. Due to its picturesque setting, the lake and surrounding parklands are very popular with tourists and hikers. In addition, the lake's position surrounded by sheer rock walls creates an echo, which is known for its clarity. On boat tours, it has become traditional to stop and play a flugelhorn or trumpet to display the echo; formerly demonstrated by shooting a cannon, it could be heard reflected up to seven times.\nObersee\n\nSt. Bartholom\u00e4, a famous pilgrimage church with a small inn nearby, is located on a peninsula about halfway down the western lakeshore. The small Christlieger island is located near its northern end. South of the K\u00f6nigssee, separated by the Salet moraine, is the smaller Obersee lake with the 470 m (1,542 ft) high R\u00f6thbach waterfall. As there is no lakeside path on the steep shore of the K\u00f6nigssee, St. Bartholom\u00e4 and the southern edge can only be reached by boat or via hiking trails up the surrounding mountains - except for harsh winters, when the lake freezes over. Stepping on the ice however can be fatal, as for a motorist in the winter of 1964, who on his way back from St. Bartholom\u00e4 drowned in his VW Beetle. The car was not detected until 1997 at a depth of about 100 m (300 ft).<\/i>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/K%c3%b6nigssee\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia<\/a>"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1301882661", "taken":"2010-07-14 10:24:47", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1338183531"}, "views":"159", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"2"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"7684107-5587584804-80328", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"Alemanha", "_content":"alemanha", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-347932", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"K\u00f6nigsee", "_content":"k\u00f6nigsee", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-1806", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"lago", "_content":"lago", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-1153739", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"St. Bartholom\u00e4", "_content":"stbartholom\u00e4", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-400", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"lake", "_content":"lake", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-283807", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"Baviera", "_content":"baviera", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-1906", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"Bavaria", "_content":"bavaria", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-434236", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"K\u00f6nigssee", "_content":"k\u00f6nigssee", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-1034", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"\u00e1gua", "_content":"\u00e1gua", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-800", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"water", "_content":"water", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-56906", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"montanha", "_content":"montanha", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7684107-5587584804-399", "author":"7704455@N02", "raw":"mountain", "_content":"mountain", "machine_tag":0}]}, "location":{"latitude":47.544719, "longitude":12.972591, "accuracy":"16", "context":"0", "locality":{"_content":"Gemeinde Sch\u00f6nau am K\u00f6nigssee", "place_id":"n.tPRO5QULwx__ddzw", "woeid":"12622729"}, "county":{"_content":"Berchtesgadener Land", "place_id":"pkJaK3VQUL8RW2dfZg", "woeid":"12596739"}, "region":{"_content":"Bavaria", "place_id":"zNsUmF9TUb5kYpMg", "woeid":"2345482"}, "country":{"_content":"Germany", "place_id":"h7eZVDlTUb50Btij9Q", "woeid":"23424829"}, "place_id":"n.tPRO5QULwx__ddzw", "woeid":"12622729"}, "geoperms":{"ispublic":1, "iscontact":0, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/mcdemoura\/5587584804\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
