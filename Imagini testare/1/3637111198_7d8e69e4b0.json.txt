The Pavilion stands 120-feet high, with a billowing headdress of brushed stainless steel ribbons that frame the stage opening and connect to an overhead trellis of crisscrossing steel pipes. The trellis supports the sound system, which spans the 4,000 fixed seats and the Great Lawn, which accommodates an additional 7,000 people.\n\nThis state-of-the-art sound system, the first of its kind in the country, was designed to mimic the acoustics of an indoor concert hall by distributing enhanced sound equally over both the fixed seats and the lawn.\n\nThe Jay Pritzker Pavilion is home to the Grant Park Music Festival and other free concerts and events. It was named in memory of Chicago business leader Jay Pritzker, who with his wife Cindy, established the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1979."}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1245277432", "taken":"2009-06-11 09:56:33", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1245446205"}, "views":"6", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"0"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/racyrachel\/3637111198\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
