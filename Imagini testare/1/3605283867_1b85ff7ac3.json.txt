This can be seen in the fact that while men pee on the streets women use &quot;sound princess&quot; devices to hide even the sound of their pee. Or again in the fact that women who express their desire are seen as being monsters, such as Hanya. \n\nAs argued by Foucalt and others, any desire that is repressed returns in other forms. The more a desire is repressed, the more it comes back in a modified cleansed, neutered way. \n\nWhile Japanese women are not allowed to give expression to their desire directly, Japanese society is awash with expressions of  de-wombed maternal love. Being cute (kawaii) is very positive and important. Perceiving things as cute (kwaiiiiiii) is likewise postive and important. And surrounding oneself with cute things, such as many &quot;hello kitty&quot; cat dolls is likewise a ritual expression of womb based sexuality without the womb. In this car there are babies everywhere but they are all made of polyester and nylon. There were even baby sized dolls on the back seat. \n\nThe hello kitty characters on the back seat are the size of young children. The numberplate is held on by Hello Kitty headed screws and the water jets for the windscreen are squirted from a Hello Kitty capped nozzle. \n\nHello Kitty is copyright. \n\nSee also the following for statistics on the number of cars with cute dolls on their dashboards in Japan.\n<a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/nihonbunka\/3077042118\/\">flickr.com\/photos\/nihonbunka\/3077042118\/<\/a>"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1244428521", "taken":"2005-06-22 17:51:29", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1340158073"}, "views":"99", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":1}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"2"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"193686-3605283867-3288", "author":"64015205@N00", "raw":"doll", "_content":"doll", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"193686-3605283867-5972356", "author":"64015205@N00", "raw":"ningyou", "_content":"ningyou", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"193686-3605283867-23314", "author":"64015205@N00", "raw":"\u4eba\u5f62", "_content":"\u4eba\u5f62", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/nihonbunka\/3605283867\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
