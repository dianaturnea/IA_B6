This is taken in my driveway in late afternoon.  The strong light approaching sunset casts magical dark shadows.  The image looks to me like what I've seen from traveling on planes over the vast unpopulated areas of the Southwest.  Doesn't it look like there is a river branching below, with dark shadows reaching down from the nearest clouds to Earth's surface and the highest altitude clouds moving along with much smoother blobs of shadow?\r\n\r\nActually, the dark shadows at the bottom of this image are from the tips of leaves on the nearby privet hedge.  The long &quot;log&quot; or pipeline in the upper central focus is a rusty nail.  If I had not taken this photo and looked at it in Photoshop, I would not have realized there was a NAIL in my driveway that needed to be picked up!\r\n\r\nAmazing what you learn from looking straight down, sometimes.  The preceeding images are also from the driveway and out to the busy street in front of my home in central Phoenix.  There is more pavement and asphalt here in this neighborhood than any other ground covering.  This is also why it gets so exceptionally hot in metro Arizona and the heat stays, held like a warming plate does, in this pavement.  Sometimes you can feel waves of heat rising up through the ground as you walk. I can't wait for &quot;winter&quot; to come!"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1128744101", "taken":"2005-10-05 18:41:47", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1292041531"}, "views":"1915", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"7"}, "notes":{"note":[{"id":"1763520", "author":"66606673@N00", "authorname":"cobalt123", "x":"397", "y":"80", "w":"50", "h":"50", "_content":"I actually like this <a href=\"http:\/\/static.flickr.com\/28\/50394454_7570e9a0b4_m.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">small<\/a> version very much."}]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"271380-50394454-811550", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"One Earth", "_content":"oneearth", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"271380-50394454-5081", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"Earth", "_content":"earth", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"271380-50394454-8946", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"down", "_content":"down", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"271380-50394454-85", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"street", "_content":"street", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"271380-50394454-863", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"Phoenix", "_content":"phoenix", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"271380-50394454-271", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"Arizona", "_content":"arizona", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"271380-50394454-657690", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"group project", "_content":"groupproject", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"271380-50394454-5086", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"pavement", "_content":"pavement", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"271380-50394454-291", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"urban", "_content":"urban", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"271380-50394454-1365313", "author":"66606673@N00", "raw":"07102005oneearth", "_content":"07102005oneearth", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/cobalt\/50394454\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
