The Buddha image is the Bhumisparsha mudra, subduing Mara or calling the earth to witness. The left hand lies in the lap, palm upward. The right hand bends over the right knee, with fingers slightly touching the ground.\nDuring meditation, Siddhartha is subjected to many temptations many posed by the evil Mara, who bombards him with his demons , monsters, violent storms and his three seductive daughters. The Buddha remains steadfast. Then to testify to Mara of his meritorious past, he points to the earth with his hand and calls the Earth Goddess. Thorani, the Earth Goddess rises from the ground and wrings the water from her long black hair, by this action raising a torrential flood that drowns Mara and his army of demons.\nThis gesture symbolizes enlightenment, as well as steadfastness (imperturbability). It is easily the most common Buddha gesture in Thai wats."}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1201378657", "taken":"2008-01-26 12:18:13", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1201526683"}, "views":"217", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"0"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"7351480-2220721355-1773", "author":"7383619@N04", "raw":"Thailand", "_content":"thailand", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"7351480-2220721355-5511", "author":"7383619@N04", "raw":"Buddha", "_content":"buddha", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/clayirving\/2220721355\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
