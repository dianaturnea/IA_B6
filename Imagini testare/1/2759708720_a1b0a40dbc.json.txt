While he had intended to reverse the spell when the battle was over, the witchdoctor himself was killed. As only he could reverse the spell to  return the ladies to their former beauty, the sisters remain in their magnificent rock formation as a reminder of this battle for generations to come. \n"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1218622912", "taken":"2008-08-12 23:12:03", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1218623678"}, "views":"60", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"0"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"3338947-2759708720-8512", "author":"55768440@N00", "raw":"Australia", "_content":"australia", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"3338947-2759708720-9507", "author":"55768440@N00", "raw":"Blue Mountains", "_content":"bluemountains", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"3338947-2759708720-17249", "author":"55768440@N00", "raw":"Three Sisters", "_content":"threesisters", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/thegirlsny\/2759708720\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
