He likes to be approached slowly, petted gently and fed treats and canned foods on the counter with his cat friends. He will tolerate combing and being picked up to a point, but really prefers to have all four paws on the counter. Since Alex is quite timid with loud noises and too much hurried human attention, he would be best for a forever home or a foster home without young children or dogs. As far as we know, Alex has excellent litter pan habits. He enjoys some time outdoors in the yard in the late morning and afternoons, but in a home would settle for a screened sunny window. He is very accustomed to having other cats around him at all times, so would be great living with other cats. He is a fairly quiet cat, usually only audible if it is mealtime and he wants to make himself heard. He likes both canned and dry foods, especially Friskies Shredded Ocean Whitefish.\n\n\nSee more pictures of Alex on Flickr:\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/arascats\/sets\/72157606987595976\/\">www.flickr.com\/photos\/arascats\/sets\/72157606987595976\/<\/a>"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1247608147", "taken":"2009-07-15 15:16:36", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1299003885"}, "views":"22", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"0"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"4739308-3721944678-65609037", "author":"77562960@N00", "raw":"Animal Rescue and Adopotion Society", "_content":"animalrescueandadopotionsociety", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"4739308-3721944678-145991", "author":"77562960@N00", "raw":"Denver, Colorado", "_content":"denvercolorado", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"4739308-3721944678-21001156", "author":"77562960@N00", "raw":"80223", "_content":"80223", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"4739308-3721944678-1344", "author":"77562960@N00", "raw":"Cat", "_content":"cat", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"4739308-3721944678-65609039", "author":"77562960@N00", "raw":"Save the Meow Meows", "_content":"savethemeowmeows", "machine_tag":0}, {"id":"4739308-3721944678-67542339", "author":"77562960@N00", "raw":"Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue", "_content":"rockymountainfelinerescue", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/arascats\/3721944678\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
