This first snowstorm of the season was supposed to fall mainly as rain, but the weather system is being impacted by what State College-based Accu-Weather is terming &quot;SuperStorm 2005.&quot; According to Penn State Campus Weather Service staff member Anthony Chipriano, an upper-level trough of low atmospheric pressure combined with the remnants of Hurricane Wilma, causing snow showers on campus and across the Northeast. As of early afternoon Tuesday, meteorologists at University Park recorded an inch of accumulated wet snow, and projected up to an additional two inches by early Wednesday from light showers and flurries, with lingering cold air maintaining slushy walkways and mostly wet roads. The storm currently is producing winds in excess of 40 mph from New Jersey to New England."}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"2005", "taken":"2010-09-01 14:33:31", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1287848748"}, "views":"39", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"0"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[{"id":"53124763-4949074849-62235777", "author":"53130103@N05", "raw":"Credit: Annemarie Mountz", "_content":"creditannemariemountz", "machine_tag":0}]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/pennstatelive\/4949074849\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
