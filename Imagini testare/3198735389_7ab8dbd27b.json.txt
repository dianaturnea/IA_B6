You fell asleep in your carseat...until 10 minutes to midnight.  You cried as the ball dropped welcoming the New Year.  I Was sad to see 2008 go too- so many firsts for all of us, so many wonderful experiences.  I know that 2009 will hold even more of those firsts and I can't wait to experience them with you.  So smile baby girl- 2009 will be exciting too!"}, "visibility":{"ispublic":1, "isfriend":0, "isfamily":0}, "dates":{"posted":"1232037056", "taken":"2009-01-15 11:21:16", "takengranularity":"0", "lastupdate":"1232037178"}, "views":"5", "editability":{"cancomment":0, "canaddmeta":0}, "publiceditability":{"cancomment":1, "canaddmeta":0}, "usage":{"candownload":1, "canblog":0, "canprint":0, "canshare":1}, "comments":{"_content":"0"}, "notes":{"note":[]}, "people":{"haspeople":0}, "tags":{"tag":[]}, "urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage", "_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sucoyant\/3198735389\/"}]}, "media":"photo"}, "stat":"ok"}
